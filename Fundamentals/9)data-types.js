//  The Concept of Data Types
//  In programming, data types is an important concept.

//  To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.
//
//
//  Data types are dynamic
//  JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:

// example

let x; // x is undefined
x = 5; // x is a number
x = "john"; // x is a string

// JavaScript Booleans

//  true or false

// example

let a = 5;
let b = 5;
let c = 7;

console.log(a === b);
console.log(a === c);
